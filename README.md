Hi y'all, my name is Michael or Mike, whichever is easier. I'm studying Astronomy/Astrophysics right now and my my long term goal is doing research in the field. I've been living in Tucson for a year and a half now but I'm a proud Texan. I spend my time studying, rock climbing, playing basketball, or writing my DnD campaign. Whatever I'm doing, I love listening to music. My main genre is alternative rap, and I'm currently loving the director's cut for I Lay Down My Life For You by JPEGMAFIA and Showbiz! by Mike. I love branching out into other genres though so if you have any recommendations I'll be sure to give them a listen.
